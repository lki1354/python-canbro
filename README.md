# python-canbro

the name of the package canbro arose from can and broqer which are the two main python packages which are used in this combination. Additionaly the cantools is also a main contributer for now. But maybe will be replaced with a own implementation in future.

This package use the python-can and extend the python-cantools with the python-broqer package. There the functionality to work in a reactive style with can signals and messages will be provided.
